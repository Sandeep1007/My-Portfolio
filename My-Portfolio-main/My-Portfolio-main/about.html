                        <h5>Weeb<span> & Designer</span></h5>
                        <p>My name is Sandeep Tripathi, and I am currently pursuing my engineering degree in Electronics and Communications at HKBK College of Engineering. I have a foundational knowledge of Verilog language and a keen interest in IoT, VLSI designing, and computer networks. Beyond my core academic pursuits, I am passionate about web designing. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS and can build projects with some reference and code adaptation. Additionally, I am currently learning React and GO.
                            My enthusiasm for technology extends to participating in hackathons, both offline and online. I aim to continue participating in these events to test and hone my skills, manage my leadership abilities.
                            Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy watching anime, listening to music, and playing cricket with my friends.</p>
